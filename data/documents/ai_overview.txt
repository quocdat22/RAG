Artificial Intelligence: An Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The field of AI research was founded
in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College.

Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience
without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can
access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep Learning
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial
neural networks. It has been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition,
natural language processing, and bioinformatics.

Applications
AI is being used in various domains:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Self-driving cars
- Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants
